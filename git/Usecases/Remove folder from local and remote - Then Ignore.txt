Use case:

1. Create maven project.
2. Push complete project to remote.
3. Observed that you don't require target folder.

Query: How to remove target folder from remote and stop tracking it in subsequent commits.

step 1: git rm --cached -r target
'git rm' kicks the file off the stage entirely, so that it's not included in the next commit snapshot, thereby effectively deleting it. 

Note: Refer commands.txt for more details on 'git rm'

step 2: git commit -m "Removed target"
step 3: git push

Now to ignore /target/ folder from subsequent commits permanently, 

step 4: Add /target/ in .gitignore file to ignore target folder when we stage by using 'git add' command.
