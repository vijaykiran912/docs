In Chapter 1, we’re going to cover Version Control Systems (VCSs) and Git
basics—no technical stuff, just what Git is, why it came about in a land full of
VCSs, what sets it apart, and why so many people are using it. Then, we’ll explain
how to download Git and set it up for the first time if you don’t already
have it on your system.

In Chapter 2, we will go over basic Git usage—how to use Git in the 80% of
cases you’ll encounter most often. After reading this chapter, you should be
able to clone a repository, see what has happened in the history of the project,
modify files, and contribute changes. If the book spontaneously combusts at
this point, you should already be pretty useful wielding Git in the time it takes
you to go pick up another copy.

Chapter 3 is about the branching model in Git, often described as Git’s killer
feature. Here you’ll learn what truly sets Git apart from the pack. When you’re
done, you may feel the need to spend a quiet moment pondering how you lived
before Git branching was part of your life.

Chapter 7 is about advanced Git commands. Here you will learn about topics
like mastering the scary reset command, using binary search to identify
bugs, editing history, revision selection in detail, and a lot more. This chapter
will round out your knowledge of Git so that you are truly a master.

Chapter 10 delves into the murky yet beautiful depths of Git internals. Now
that you know all about Git and can wield it with power and grace, you can
move on to discuss how Git stores its objects, what the object model is, details
of packfiles, server protocols, and more. Throughout the book, we will refer to
sections of this chapter in case you feel like diving deep at that point; but if you
are like us and want to dive into the technical details, you may want to read
Chapter 10 first. We leave that up to you.
