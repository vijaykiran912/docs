1) Difference between Single page application and Multi page application
ans) In singel page application we do not need to go back to server every time, everything is managed by Javascript.
     In single page appliation there is only one ReactDOM.render() call which will manage all the react componenets. (Root element rendered to the DOM will mount all other components)
